# Storage exception: Connection Reset causing table truncating half-done

We have a customer periodically running the truncating table process on HBase cluster. There was a short time period of Storage connection issue causing the truncating half-done: the table entry was deleted in hbase metadata table, and most of table files had been deleted, only one blob file "/hbase/data/default/ThatTable/80b488992339bc79ef79d8c11b8214124/recovered.edits/0000000000000052121‚Äù left there. From the stale Master UI, you will see the table still there, but with 0 online regions and 0 offline regions. 

Although there is no folder blob called "/hbase/data/default/ThatTable" sitting in the storage. Our WASB driver finds the existence of the above blob and will not allow to create any blob called "/hbase/data/default/ThatTable" because it assumed the parent folders existing, thus creating table will fail.

The mitigations are

1. From ambari UI, restart the active HMaster. This will let one of the two standby HMaster becoming the active one and the new active HMaster will reload the metadata table info. Thus you will not see the "already-deleted" table in HMaster UI.

2. You can find the orphan blob file from UI tools like "cloudExplorer" or running command like "hdfs dfs -ls /xxxxxx/yyyyy". Run "hdfs dfs -rmr /xxxxx/yyyy" to delete that blob. Here is "hdfs dfs -rmr /hbase/data/default/ThatTable/80b488992339bc79ef79d8c11b8214124/recovered.edits/0000000000000052121".

3. Now you can create new table with the same name in HBase.
