### How do I configure Spark application through LIVY on HDInsight clusters?

#### Issue:

Need to configure at submit time through LIVY, the amount of memory and number of cores that a Spark application can use on HDInsight clusters. 

1. Refer to the topic [Why did my Spark application fail with OutOfMemoryError?](spark-application-failure-with-outofmemoryerror.md) to determine which Spark configurations need to be set and to what values.

2. Submit the Spark application to LIVY using a REST client like CURL with a command similar to the following (change the actual values as applicable):

~~~~
curl -k --user 'username:password' -v -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{ "file":"wasb://container@storageaccountname.blob.core.windows.net/example/jars/sparkapplication.jar", "className":"com.microsoft.spark.application", "numExecutors":4, "executorMemory":"4g", "executorCores":2, "driverMemory":"8g", "driverCores":4}'  
~~~~
