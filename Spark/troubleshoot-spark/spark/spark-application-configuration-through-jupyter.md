### How do I configure Spark application through Jupyter notebook on HDInsight clusters?

#### Issue:

Need to configure the amount of memory and number of cores that a Spark application can use when using Jupyter notebook on HDInsight clusters. 

1. Refer to the topic [Why did my Spark application fail with OutOfMemoryError?](spark-application-failure-with-outofmemoryerror.md) to determine which Spark configurations need to be set and to what values.

2.  Specify the Spark configurations in valid JSON format in the first cell of the Jupyter notebook after the %%configure directive (change the actual values as applicable):
