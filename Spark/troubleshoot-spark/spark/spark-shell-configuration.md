### How do I configure spark-shell on HDInsight clusters?

#### Issue: Need to configure the amount of memory and number of cores that spark-shell can use. 

#### Resolution Steps:  

1. Refer to the topic [Why did my Spark application fail with OutOfMemoryError?](spark-application-failure-with-outofmemoryerror.md) to determine which Spark configurations need to be set and to what values. 

2. Launch spark-shell with a command similar to the following (change the actual value of the configurations as applicable): 

~~~~
spark-shell --num-executors 4 --executor-memory 4g --executor-cores 2 --driver-memory 8g --driver-cores 4
~~~~
