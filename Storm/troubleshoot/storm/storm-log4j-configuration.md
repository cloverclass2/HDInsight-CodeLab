## Where are Storm Log4J configuration files on HDInsight clusters?

### Issue:

Identify Log4J configuration files for Storm services.

#### On HeadNodes:
Nimbus Log4J configuration is read from:
/usr/hdp/<HDPVersion>/storm/log4j2/cluster.xml

#### Worker Nodes
Supervisor's Log4J configuration is read from:
/usr/hdp/<HDPVersion>/storm/log4j2/cluster.xml

Worker Log4J configuration file is read from:
/usr/hdp/<HDPVersion>/storm/log4j2/worker.xml

Example:
/usr/hdp/2.6.0.2-76/storm/log4j2/cluster.xml
/usr/hdp/2.6.0.2-76/storm/log4j2/worker.xml
